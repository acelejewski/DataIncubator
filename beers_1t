","Pat-ASK-ala? Pata-SKALA? Pa-TASK-a-la? While those in the know favor the third pronunciation, no matter how you say it, this is a unique red IPA. The beer was first brewed in September 2015 to support music and arts education programs in Pataskala, Ohio, where Stone co-founder Greg Koch grew up. People there loved it, so we added the beer to our seasonal lineup. The deep crimson hue is courtesy of a fairly new special German malt variety by BESTMALZ called Red X. Dry-hopped with Mosaic, Cascade and Amarillo hops, this beer is incredibly citrus-forward, rounded out with biscuit and toffee notes.

Named after the motto of House Targaryen, Fire and Blood is inspired by Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion. To celebrate the rebirth of dragons, three different labels were created by the Game of Thrones visual effects specialists, each depicting one of Daenerys' feared dragons. Randomly distributed amongst the cases, each case will contain all three bottles.
On sale March 31, in time for the debut of Season 4, Fire and Blood makes for the perfect season premiere pairing. The beer is available in 750ml bottles and 1/6 barrel kegs.
Fire & Blood is a 6.8% ABV Red ale, brewed with pilsner, Cara-60, Midnight Wheat, flaked rye and spelt. Assertive hopping includes CTZ, Styrian Golding and German Tettnang hops. Spiced with de-seeded Ancho chilies. Fire & Blood has a deep, dark red hue with a persistent, creamy, off-white head.

Using only traditional ingredients, Switchback Ale is a reddish-amber ale which is particularly well-balanced, allowing for complexity of flavor coupled with an unusually smooth and refreshing character. Five different malts, select hop varieties, and our own specially cultivated yeast create an ale which leads with hop flavors and a subtle impression of fruit (our yeast's contribution), followed by a palate pleasing malty finish.

","AutumnFest is Weyerbacher’s own unique twist on the German Oktoberfest style. Copper-amber in color, AutumnFest is made with Vienna and Munich malts for that authentic, Bavarian easy drinking taste. Each sip imparts a wonderful roastiness of malt on the tongue followed by a smooth, consistent finish.
Wonderfully balanced with a clean, velvety, slightly fruity taste, AutumnFest is the perfect beer for the Fall – a nice transition between the lighter beers of summer and the darker, heavier winter brews. It’s a favorite of many Weyerbacher aficionados, who anticipate the end of summer with this wonderful beer.

","Stop seven on our multi-year trip to explore the state of New Jersey through its beer and culture, is Exit 9, best known as the Rutgers University exit. The state’s university, Rutgers, began in 1771 with classes held at a local tavern though by 1810, students were banned from frequenting “beer and oyster houses.” Alumni include Nobel Laureates, astronauts, brewery founders, authors, actors and perhaps most notably, the cartoon character Mr. Magoo.
To celebrate Exit 9, we brewed a richly flavored red beer crafted with a variety of domestic and imported malts and a classic American yeast strain. Assertively hopped with Amarillo, Centennial, Chinook and Citra, the bouquet has complex notes of citrus and tropical fruits, with an appropriate bitterness in the finish. Serve it with spicy foods (try gumbo or curry), a rich blue or sharp cheddar cheese or enjoy it by itself.Added by womencantsail on 02-11-2011"

It is a clean, well-balanced beer that started as seasonal ale that we only brewed from March until July. It was so popular with our regulars that we started brewing it year round in 2002. Our red ale is made with only two hop additions to the kettle as opposed to three in most of our other brews and the malt character shows this. Please enjoy our staff favorite!

","A double red ale that seems to indicate an intensity of flavor simply by it’s dark reddish brown appearance. Subtle aromas of candy, brown sugar, and toasted malt seem reluctantly released from the depths of this full bodied beast. Raisins, figs, and burnt caramel are among some of the sweeter flavors up front, before giving way to a roasted cocoa like bitterness that becomes magnified by high alpha hops. Considering the initial overall sweetness, it’s a heightened bitterness that dominates the finish.

This is a heavy-duty 9% abv red ale with a profusion of hop flavor and aroma.  This beer is as big and proud as Texas. Because we add almost two pounds of American hops per barrel very late in the beer making process, The Imperial Texan is able to retain a wondrously piney and resinous hop character that perfectly balances its smooth but strong and dry malt backbone.  This beer has a sticky presence that puts each sip perfectly on the tongue.

The beer was such a hit at this party, we decided to start Prism Brewing Company.
Brewed with a special blend of honey from a Chester county apiary, this well balanced ale has a great malt/honey backbone to blend with the citrus hops. Coming in at 67 IBU’s, we balance the use of hops across the spectrum of bittering, flavoring, and aroma profiles.

","Formerly Rebel Kent The First
Every sip of Rebel Kent is a science experiment in your mouth. We’ve always been fascinated by the Abbey Single, the beer of choice for Belgian monks working the fields. They were low in alcohol and high in flavor, but had one problem: they were cloyingly sweet. So we hit the books to develop a modern take on that classic idea. We found our answer in an unlikely place: the human tongue. We learned that our palates experience flavor in stages: sweetness at the front and spiciness at the back, and we designed a beer that follows that pattern. The sweetness from the Belgian yeast hits first, and is quickly balanced by a rye-malt spice, leaving you with a clean palate, ready for the next science-y sip.
This is our daily drinker, an amber ale for today’s hard workers. It’s a nod to our brewing ancestors: the rebel monks of the fields.

","Scarlet Fire is an Irish/American style Red Ale. The name is a reference to the playful, improvisational transitions between Grateful Dead songs Scarlet Begonias and Fire on the Mountain. Great balance of malt sweetness from caramel malt and subtle toasty notes from roasted barley. Brewed withj American Ale yeast, and East Kent Golding hops, it pays tribute to it's heritage as an Irish Red Ale.

","This beer is a revival of a beer style that was one of the most popular beers in America prior to prohibition: Kentucky Common Ale. It has a dark color with a rich flavorful taste and a decent hint of hops (22 IBU), but it is light and easy drinking.
Many people today mistakenly think that this style is supposed to have a sour taste, but our research led us to the over 100 year old ""American Handy Book of the Brewing, Malting & Auxiliary Trades"" (see page 818) which makes no mention of it having a sour quality or using a sour mash to brew it.
Instead, it was just a dark yet refreshing beer that the working class people of the time loved to drink very fresh, which was around 2 weeks after being brewed. We also serve up Common Sense 14 days after brewing it. It is a great resurrected beer for all modern beer lovers!Added by tviz33 on 06-15-2013"

","This is a big, bold beer that is loaded with five types of hops but also backed up with a hearty grain that establishes balance and body. This deep copper coloured beer has beautiful spicy and a slight citrus hops note right from the start with a rounded malt finish accompanying the hop bitterness.
Immediately after pouring the beer, you will notice a full, rocky head form at the top of your glass that preserves all the flavour and allows the slow release of the hop focused aroma. As you drink and enjoy your beer you will notice the head take on a thick and rocky appearance as it creates some wonderful lacing down the side of your glass.

","Our Bone Warmer is brewed the same way, using only the first runnings from an extraordinarily thick, strong mash of Idaho 2-Row Metcalfe and Harrington barley malt, along with dark German Munich and caramel malts. We subtly spiced it with Idaho Chinook hops, fermented it at cool temperatures and cold-conditioned it for smoothness and drinkability.
The resulting ale is the color of roasting chestnuts. It is voluptuously malty and only slightly sweet- with a hint of toffee and a warming dry finish. It’s an ideal accompaniment to rich meaty stews, wild game, roasted fowl or root vegetables, and aged cheddars.Added by Bitterbill on 01-13-2007"

","A mid strength ale like no other
Velvet smooth, Rogers weaves together the best whole hop flowers and toasted malts into a silky mid strength ale like no other. We’re always open to new ideas and seeking advice from others and with this beer we salute two great men and legends of Australian brewing who helped us along the way; Roger Bailey and Roger Bussell.
With a gentle nod to the traditions of fine English Ales and a distinctive Little Creatures hop driven slant, Rogers’ beer may be hard to classify but it’s reassuringly easy to drink…
Whole hop flowers used in the brewing process deliver a gentle bitterness and light citrus hop notes that weave together with roasted toffee and caramel malt flavours to create this unique, easy-drinking amber ale.

","Why should St. Patrick’s Day just be a “day” when you can make a whole season out of it?! Crack open The Craic and let the friendly banter, bursts of laughter, and toe-tapping music of the season get your eyes smiling.
This hybrid ale combines two classic styles —IPA and Irish Red Ale—to create a unique and flavorful beer. Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.
The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. 
Check ‘em out: 
Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). 
Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.
Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. 
Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. 
Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. 
Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!Added by braican on 11-21-2016"

","Your father’s red ale was pretty to look at but not much to drink, seriously in need of a personality transplant. But over the years, red ales have turned into the real deal, with a character as lively and big as any pale ale. Reppin’ Red blends seven malts for layer upon layer of caramel and toasted toffee with the uniquely peppery spiciness of rye and tops it all off with a mix of selected Pacific Northwest hops, chosen for their lively flavors and sophisticated aromas of flowers, pine and citrus. It’s a big beer that demands big food. Reppin’ Red is fantastic with grilled meat and steaks, and totally rocks a burger. For something different, try it with blue cheese or a nice, sweet slice of carrot cake—you’ll be amazed.Added by dhannes on 08-28-2012"

","It was important to us to create a beer that was well balanced and easy drinking. John Carr achieved this with Trout Town American Amber Ale. True to its name TTAA has a beautiful Amber color and produces a near perfect head when pouring. The blend has a very light citrus finish, with balanced malt and hops. By no means is it extreme in anyway. It has a nice light finish and is a great product to enjoy all night long or while relaxing after spending the day in the great outdoors! This style of beer would have been typically brewed in New York State during the early 1900's. IBU's 30-40, Color (SRM) 8-18, ABV 5 – 6%.Added by Jason on 10-01-2013"

","Downpour balances on the boarder between malt and huge hop flavors, much like the balance between warm summer days and the bitter cold thunderstorms we get here in the high country of Colorado. The beer pours a hazy redwood red with a white fluffy head. Hops dominate the nose with pine, earth, and grapefruit balanced slightly by caramel malt flavors and hints of our fruity London Ale yeast. The beer hits the palate with bitter hop notes of pine and is balanced by bready malt. A beer for the hop freaks among us.

","Hard water. Appropriate for a pale ale style, this gives something for the hop oils to stick to, and the right water chemistry and pH levels for a proper British style bitter or pale ale. Our water chemistry provides mineral flavor and body to complement the complex malt and hop ingredients that are drawn from the best of English, German and Pacific Northwestern U.S. traditions and sources.  The mineral factor enhances the processing steps in mashing, sparging, boiling, fermenting and conditioning. The malt bill includes English 2-row Pale Ale Barley Malt and Malted Whole Wheat. Hops include Chinook, Hallertau, Cascade, Willamette and Tettnang. Shipyard's lively Ringwood culture (a top-fermenting ""ale"" yeast) is used to ferment the beer, as was the case when we brewed in Hartford.Added by Billolick on 07-25-2006"

The aroma leads off with an appealing fruitiness, produced by our house yeast, which gives way to a rich caramel aroma which, in turn, is followed by the herbal character of our finishing hops.

","Doc Perdue was Blyth’s veterinarian in the late 1880’s who had a penchant for collecting exotic animals and a love of drink.

West Coast American Pale Ales and IPAs have inspired Doc Perdue’s Bobcat. Hops are loaded from top to bottom in this ruby red beer showing off aromatic pine, zest, fresh citrus and tropical fruit.

","The town of Long Valley was originally called German Valley after the German immigrants that first settled in and cultivated it's fertile land. Evidence of these first settlers can still be seen in the skillful stone construction of many of the Valley's buildings and barns, including the Long Valley Pub and Brewery. The original walls and graves of a 16th century Lutheran church can still be found just across the bridge on Fairview Avenue. The German Valley Amber Ale derives its firebrick red color from a combination of crystal and specially roasted malts. This is an assertive beer with a notable bitterness and respectable strength. Willamette hops are used in generous quantities to make this pleasantly hop-flavored ale.Added by yen157 on 02-16-2003"

","Meet Red Ryder - a deep cherry red that captures your gaze and holds it for ransom. Her motive is simple: Give you what you want.

When the smoke clears and the windows open, Centennial hops fill the room with a clean, flowery citrus aroma. Stockholm syndrom never tasted so good.Added by Rizalini on 06-29-2011"

","What?
Inspired by the malty and hoppy beers of the Great Northwest, Green Man Ale is a rich and layered beer that lies somewhere between an IPA and a Red Ale—not exactly radical, but not quite the conformist, Green Man Ale just is.
Why?
An Eclectic blend of malts and plenty of northwest hops have come together, not worrying about fitting in, and simply being content in walking their own path of malty hoppiness (always need a good hop pun). Green Man is excellent when paired with wild salmon or as an inspirational elixir during your favorite pagan ceremony.Added by Domingo on 02-12-2012"

","From the Yazoo Brewmaster's Blog:
Fall Ale is made with all German malts - Munich, Vienna, Cara malt, and a little bit of Rye. It's generously hopped with Hallertauer and Tettnang hops from Germany. It's an ale, not a lager, but it's loosely based on a typical Octoberfest beer, with our own twist with the Rye malt.Added by Misfit138 on 10-17-2009"

","A deep garnet, Iron Spike Amber pours a dense frothy beige cap with good lacing and retention. To the nose, toasted notes of dark bread and caramel malts as well as deeply rooted dark fruits give way to a perfume of bubblegum, banana, and yeasty esters. 
The flavour profile is initially sweet with dark fruit and caramel. This leads to toasted and spicy flavours with a hint of smoke and fall fruits while the hops come through to balance the sweetness. This full-bodied amber ale is an ideal balance of creamy grainy fruitiness, and sharp hops bitterness.Added by mrmanning on 06-06-2008"

","A kin to its Scottish and Irish cousins, this American Red Ale is full bodied and smooth. Its blend of caramel and specialty malts give this ale a deep amber color and a silky smooth malty texture. It’s gentle touch of American hops balance the malt sweetness and provide just a touch of earthy flavors. A slight astringency accompanies this on the sides of the tongue from chocolate malt which lends to the ruby red color. It finishes smooth and dry.

","The newest addition to the Forked River lineup is a bold Canadian red ale. Hopped exclusively with North American varietals, this amped up pale ale delivers their citrusy goodness alongside significant caramel flavours and a little residual malt sweetness, helping to balance the elevated bitterness. Clocking somewhere between a pale ale and an IPA, Red Coat is a full-flavoured, 6.2% ABV, 45 IBU, dry-hopped red ale.  We brewed this beer specifically for BBQ weather - it fits perfectly beside a juicy burger or strip loin steak, cutting right through that richness without stripping away any flavour from that amazing grilled goodness.Added by MasterSki on 05-14-2015"

","This beer is the third installment of a beer brewed for head brewpub brewer Wil’s daughters, Gabrielle and Ciara. (First Hop Princess, then Rebellious, and now Battle of Wil's.)
Patagonia malt gives this medium-bodied brew its amber/reddish hue and toffee-like notes in the nose. On front of the palate, however, it is quite mild - not as sweet as one might expect. The single hop variety used, Centennial, makes its fresh presence known mid-palate.
The beer finishes clean, with a medium hop bitterness. Though a shade darker than the Iron Fist, it is lighter-bodied, a bit cleaner, and a bit lower IBUs.

","This is our version of the American Amber Ale style, and is amber in color (of course), medium bodied, with toasty malt flavors, and a subtle hop finish. This beer is brewed from Montana-grown and malted Metcalfe 2-row barley, two kinds of English crystal malts and just a hint of torrifed (toasted) wheat, and is lightly hopped with Magnum and British East Kent Goldings. Easy drinking yet always satisfying.

","Double Dry Hopped Imperial Red India Pale Ale
Inspired by one of the greatest race horses to ever live, Secretariat’s Meadow is a grand-champion in the making. As dark in color as the Triple Crown winner and with a heart twice the size of the competition, Secretariat’s Meadow explodes with the flavor and aroma of Mosaic hops. Mosaic hops feature complex flavors and aromas akin to tangerines, papaya, roses and fresh blossoms. To enhance these characteristics we double dry-hopped the beer for maximum effect. Born in The Meadow. Destined for Greatness.

","This Scottish Red Ale is full bodied, with a natural sweetness and rounded balance derived from a rich blend of malts and light hops. At 5% ABV, it is a sessionable ale that goes with any meal. This beer was first introduced by MBC in 2008 and won the award for “Best Montana Beer” at the Garden City Brewfest. The real “Devil’s Hump” is in Flathead County, Montana, not far from the Hungry Horse Reservoir, just south of Highway 2, and rises to 7,618 feet above sea level.Added by Darkmagus82 on 03-06-2016"

","Our Absolution Ale is an American Amber Ale in style. This is a style that has evolved in the last 12 years with the explosion of the microbrewery movement. Ours was brewed with American Grains, American hops, and by American brewers. It is a reasonably big beer with a full profile. This means that it has a big body and a good balance of the malt and hops with neither overpowering the other. The body of the Absolution Ale is full with nice caramel tones, and should finish a touch sweet. The hop character is most noticeable as a hop flavor although it will have some hop bitterness in the finish. Let me know how you like it.Added by BeerAdvocate on 04-12-2006"

","Amber beers are a style that fall between light pale ales and brown ales.  They are generally categorized as pale ale.  This beer is dark amber in colour, has traces of citrus in its aroma, and one can pick up hints of caramel and coffee in its full bodied flavour.  Though it is fairly well hopped, the robust character and complexity of this fine amber turns it into nectar of the gods that no serious beer drinker should pass up.

","Originally created for Cask Days, this beer is a hoppy but not bitter, full-bodied red ale. We triple-hopped this batch with Legacy, Simcoe, and Galaxy to create subtle blueberry, citrus and pine notes to compliment it’s caramel malt flavour. Weighing in at 6.2% ABV with a deep ruby red hue, this beer is calculated at 40 IBUs to showcase the hops without overpowering the palate.Added by MasterSki on 10-24-2014"

","In this hop-forward twist on the classic amber ale, we utilize a heavy dry hop with Simcoe hops to bring about a balancing layer of complexity. Malts meet hops in a symbiosis of character that includes passion fruit, pine sap, grapefruit pith, toasted grain, caramel sweetness, and floral resin. A semi-dry finish with lasting bitterness have this drinking like an India Amber Ale.Added by LauderALe on 12-14-2015"

","Drink Well Red Ale is as complex as it is simple. A robust Irish style red ale with a uniquely American twist. A floral nose with a touch of citrus coming from American Willamette Hops leads into a rich, malty backbone with big caramel and toffee notes, met in the middle with a distinctly toasty, mildly chocolaty finish. This drinking ale goes down smooth and finishes just dry enough to leave you craving another sip, then another pint!Added by Dicers on 03-16-2015"

","Our Red Ale has a blend of medium to dark crystal malts to give way to a toasted caramel profile. Mosaic, Galaxy, Cascade and Centennial hops are used throughout, giving this dry hopped beer notes of pineapple, stone fruit, and grassy hop flavors and aromas. The Red Ale has a firm bitterness that does not overpower, but balances the sweetness of the malt and then ends with a dry session-able finish.Added by Boone757 on 03-27-2014"

","Oaked Imperial Red IPA 
It is often said that behind every good man stands a strong woman. Well, in the case of Todd & Linda Haug of Minneapolis brewing fame, this is not quite accurate. Because Linda Haug was never placed behind her husband, rather she’s up there right next to him - and always has been. Two years ago we brewed ""Todd - The Axe Man"" (a beer title we had to come up with, Todd is way too humble to even suggest anything like that) which has been hugely successful, both in its Danish and its American incarnation. So we found it only fitting to brew a beer for Linda, Todd’s partner in crime in every aspect of life, since this couple has become very good friends of Amager. Linda is not only cool and badass, she also has the biggest heart you can imagine. And for the brew day she came here and worked her butt off to brew the beer we created as a collaboration. Here’s to you Linda - because next to every axe man, there’s an axe grinding wife….Added by josanguapo on 10-26-2016"

","Rob Your Head Imperial Red - an autumnally inspired seasonal recipe - is riding back into town and this time it's bringing posse! Join us at the beginning of fall for draft return + 16 oz. can release of this deep malty rouge, dry-hopped Imperial Red Ale. 
Originally brewed on our 5-barrel pilot system, the return of this stark Imperial Red Ale complements our year-round offerings during the fall. Roasted & caramel malts deliver a robust, ruby body that is balanced by assertive bitterness and a big dry-hop of classic American IPA hops. Simcoe + Amarillo combine for piney and citrusy aromas to make this beer one to enjoy from first glance to last sip.Added by bigwilley18 on 04-17-2016"

","RIP Tyson Archimedes Montrucchio. Gone, but certainly not forgotten we brewed this kickass Red Ale for our fallen friend Tyson. As a tribute to the intensity with which he lived life we packed this beer with a sh*t ton of love and respect. From a grain bill comprised of 2-Row Pale, Crystal 75, Munich, Victory (that’s where the biscuityness comes from), and Chocolate malts, to a hop profile of Cascade and Mt. Hood, we didn’t pull any punches on this one. As a full bodied Red Ale that isn’t over the top, the Archimedes Red is our TCB go to beer, and is a constant reminder that we all need to be thankful for each new day with our friends and family.

","The Wrangler Red ale is a clear, deep reddish brown color and full bodied.  It begins with moderate hop and caramel aromas and a creamy mouth-feel. The Wrangler red provides strong malt flavors that create mild sweetness followed by smooth caramel flavor.  The malt and low hop bitterness nicely balance into the slight roasty finish.

","This amber ale was brewed in the style of a German altbier. 'Altbier' literally means 'old beer,' referring to the era when Germans brewed ales instead of the lagers of today. The style is a bit of a hybrid of ale and lager in that it is brewed with an ale yeast, but is fermented at cooler than normal temperatures for an ale, and aged (lagered) before serving. The resulting beer has a pleasing malt character character, but is drier and not as heavy as most of our beers. The maltiness is balanced by a crisp hop character that is spicier than it is bitter. The fact that the hops are all of German origin accounts for this spicy hoppiness. The Amber is a deep copper color, which makes it an attractive as well as tasty brew.""

","Brewed with imported pale malt, Honey malt for flavor, three types of caramel malt for color and flavor, Vienna and Munich malt for body. The ruby red color hints at its rich caramel maltiness. Hopped with a good amount of German hops to tame the sweetness. This is a perfect middle-of-the-road beer for those who do not want a beer that is too light, too dark, or too bitter.

","One of our most popular brews this one is the perfect balance of English style maltiness and an American influenced hop bill. While the caramel malts add a rich sweetness and beautiful deep color the hops stand out giving just enough earthy and citrus bitterness to the brew to provide a slight crispness making it easy to drink on any given day. 5% ABV 54 IBUsAdded by Todd on 05-25-2014"

","There is such a thing as true happiness. The proof: whiskey and beer. So we worked with our Irish brethren to help marry the two. Introducing Imperial Irish Red Aged in Jameson Barrels. This richly robust, mahogany-hued ale has notes of fig, toffee, tobacco and whiskey. Aged for 6 months in Jameson Irish Whiskey barrels, this full bodied-beer has flavors of vanilla, molasses, dried stone fruits and black cherries with a distinctly peppery finish. Indulgent, subtly sweet with a warming linger, this is a beer meant to be sipped and savored.Added by jaydoc on 07-11-2016"

","This full-bodied Red IPA is packed with floral and spicy American-grown hops. The deep red color comes from the amber waves of Crystal, Munich and a-row malt, just like the rust on the Rattle Trap in the garage. Subtle caramel notes bring balance to the nose, and the piney citrus finish lingers like a summer sunset on the lake!

","This is not your typical Amber beer. We’re big fans of rye, and we couldn’t pass up a chance to use it in a new way. Rye, caramel malts, and lightly roasted barley set up an interesting malt foundation for fruity and herbaceous hops. We’re also huge fans of Belgian style ales, so we threw caution to the wind and fermented it all with a clean, fruity yeast. It’s easy to drink, but it has a bit more complexity and depth than you might expect from an Amber.

","This medium-bodied Amber Ale hints of dark fruity raisin, currants, and ripe plum. Slightly sweet and nutty from a blend of toasted malts including a touch of Chocolate Malt and flaked Barley, and balanced off with a nice mix of Northwest hops."

","Description: 
Inspired by our favorite local Thai restaurant, this recipe blends all of the flavors that make this dessert such a unique treat. A Copper Ale base incorporates Khal Koah (Thai toasted rice infused with lemongrass and kefir lime leaves) into the mash, then added coconut, brown sugar, and spicy Thai peppers in the boil. We, of course, finished with a full bunch our own “Farmhouse Flambéed” Bananas.

","Parcel of Rogues is a full-bodied Amber Ale - made with Mild malt, and some Honey Malt which adds a nice delicate sweetness. There's lots mouthfeel without a high alcohol content - it rings in at 4.6%/ABV. It's intended to be a throwback to the days of being able to have a good hearty beer or two in the afternoon, and still be functional - it's a Session Ale for all intents and purposes!

","The Jagged Shard Imperial Red Ale clocks in at 8.4% ABV and 80 IBU's. This brew pours a dark red copper color and offers a pleasant citrus fruit aroma. Very balanced flavor profile between the strong melanoiden rich malt backbone and the complimentary but assertive hop character. Very smooth and deceiving for a high gravity brew until you feel the unmistakable alcohol warmth in your cheeks after a few sips.

","Lonesome Boatman Red Ale has a big brother. His name is Electric Boatman Imperial Red Ale, and he's visiting for the first time in...well, Lonesome Boatman can't remember when. What exactly will happen when Electric Boatman arrives? I guess you'll have to let us know.
We took the Lonesome Boatman recipe and ""imperialized"" it. Same malts, same hops, same lovable Lonesome Boatman flavor...except Electric Boatman weighs in at 8% ABV and is boldly dry hopped with Simcoe hops. Simcoe brightens up the Boatman family, so we wish your experience with family and friends is every bit as wonderful as this new brew.

","This Imperial Red Ale is named after a 1927 Lafrance Fire Truck, which was the only thing standing after a tornado devastated downtown Gainesville in 1935. The Leaping Lena is a rich amber to copper in color and entices with aromatic notes of chocolate, vanilla, and spicy undertones. It is medium to full bodied providing a great mouthfeel without being heavy to the palate. Use of Bravo hops provides a very well balanced, clean finish with slight hints of pine and very subtle fruit.Added by Arkelope on 09-17-2016"

","Brewed with house-toasted wheat from Camas Country Mill, there’s plenty of toasty, nutty and malty tones in this silky smooth Red Ale. Balanced with Nugget and Fuggle hops and our spring house yeast, there are plenty of layers of fruitiness and maltiness, with just enough bitterness to keep it crisp. Savor the flavors as the sun goes down and this balanced brew takes you into the dusk on a warm spring evening.Added by GoBeerGo on 04-14-2016"

","This superhumanly balanced brew blasts the tastebuds with a shot of hops then closes with a polished malty finish. Its intricate harmony between hop and malt was only achieved through years of intense training. Many have tried to mimic this recipe, however all have failed and been sentenced to mediocrity. This legend pours amber in color but appears ruby when held to the light. A full, off-white head laces the glass with great retention. Aroma begins with a citrus/pine hops note but balances midway with a rich caramel malt presence. The flavor starts with an exploding American hop essence but balances with a warm crystal, caramel malt focus. It’s well balanced for such a hoppy malt beer. The full finish has lingering hop and caramel sweetness well after the last sip.Added by brywhite on 02-25-2015"

","We’ll be the first to say it… Ambers are boring. If beer was a middle school, ambers would be western civilization class.
However, after multiple requests; Our head brewer Lance reluctantly took on the challenge of making an amber we could all be excited about. The result is a surprisingly thrilling, toasty - caramel treat. Modestly hopped with el dorado, Chinook, and cascade hops straight from Idaho farms, this beer still has enough hop kick to keep it interesting. Toasty on the nose with a honey-nut accented flavor, this well balanced amber fits the style without leaving you drooling on your trapper keeper.Added by JohnGalt1 on 11-12-2015"

","Rocket Science Red Planet displays the malt driven elements of a traditional Red Ale but with the added kick of an IPA hopping regime. The deep, copper red colour showcases the abundance of specialty malts used in the brew.
On the nose there is particular interest as the floral, peachy hop aromas intertwine with the pine, rustic and earthy aromas and underlying malt flavour.
In the mouth Red Planet displays a rich malty texture, and flavours of burnt toffee. The finish is lengthy with distinct hop bitterness adding intrigue long after the last mouthful.

","Only Lead grown hops (Cascade, Centennial, Chinook, and Columbus) went into this small batch harvest-time ale. 50 ounces of our 2015 crop were added to the boil kettle right off the vine. High Lovibond crystal malt provides the deep red color and sweet toffee taste. 
In the early days of the gold rush, nearly everything needed for shelter or mining was ""hand hewn"" from the local timber, just as this beer was made from hand-picked local hops and hand crafted in our brew haus.Added by cbcrunch on 12-06-2015"

","This is one of our ‘Brew Master’ Dave Barratt’s favourite beers.
It is an easy drinking beer that is smoothly hopped where the character is mostly driven by Willamette hops with its harmony of flower, fruits, earth and spice aromas. The beer has a deep and complex malt and yeast character that that comes from the mix of pale and caramel malts with roasted barley added to help give that iconic red colour. For the yeast we use a traditional American variety that gives a dry and clean finish to enhance the hop details. For Dave this is the perfect balance between malt, hops and yest.
Grains: Pale Ale, Pilsner, with some Darker Malts and Roasted Barley
Hops: Magnum, Willamette, CascadeAdded by bark on 03-13-2016"

","Bursting with the flavors and dry-hopped aromas of Cascade hops, Cascadia brings a little bit of the Northwest Coast to the Midwest. Expect a moderate hop aroma to show through a blend of roasted and deep caramel malts. The floral- citrus hop flavors that define the Northwest style are preset here, and are bolstered by an intricate blend of grains that finishes dry but with a caramel and nutty aftertaste that practically begs for a second sip. The base grains come from the small family farm that provides the malt for our High Desert Pale Ale.Added by JLaw55 on 02-26-2018"

","Do you like caramel?  Do you like the color Red?   Is sweet better than spicy to you?  If so, this is your beer.  This is a West Coast style Red Ale, created by Maribeth “M.B.” Raines, AKA “The Beer Diva”.  You don’t have to be a “Diva” to drink it, but after a few, you might feel like one, and that is okay.

","RUBY RED OZ Ruby Red Oz is a port wine barrel-aged ale. The flavor starts with a light amount of acidic, salty tanginess and moves on to a slight bitterness and tannic mouthfeel, with notes of oak. With interesting nuances of spice and earthiness throughout, the dark fruit, port wine warmth shines through on the finish. This beer pours a ruby red/orange color with a sweet and grainy aroma.Added by bluejacket74 on 09-15-2017"

","For people who love IPAs but like a little more malt sweetness. We use American 2-row, Munich, Carapils, Crystal-15 and Crystal-120, and a little chocolate malt to add some oomph.

","Taste that Withstands the Test of Time™
The brewing of ale is recorded in written histories of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia dating to at least the 5th millennium BC, making it one of the oldest beverages ever produced by humans. Evidence indicates that fermentation of grain drinks routinely took place is Persia around 7,000 years ago. Otzi’s Twenty Nine™ Copper Ale has its origins in the old style amber ales of Northern Europe that were amber to coppery-brown in color. The style, sometimes referred to as “red ale,” exhibits a well-balanced presentation tipping slightly toward its malt characteristics. The BCBC blend of six malts and various hop varieties allows for exceptional body with caramel overtones that hint of chocolate. Expect the brew to surprise with a subtle, fruity finish. All in all, a very sessionable ale deserving of exploration to find just the right pairing to compliment the moment’s mood and your individual taste preferences.Added by Dicers on 08-01-2015"

","For quite sometime Scott has been asking me to brew a dedication of sorts to one of his favorite beers, Sierra Nevada Celebration. With its unmistakable pine and citrus character from the hops and its classic west coast red/amber malt base, celebration is one of those styles of beer that you just don’t see that often anymore. With this in mind we set out to do our interpretation of this old yet classic style, this is our American Red Ale. We brewed the his beer with a solid malt bill including Munich malt, Rye Malt and Roasted Barley. The hopping on this was intense with heavy additions of Chinook, Idaho 7, and Simcoe, and late additions of Falconers Flight for a classic west coast flavor and aroma. Call it a West Coast IPA or call it an American Red Ale we don’t care it’s just something that we enjoy drinking and we hope you do too.
Maris Otter, Munich, Rye Malt, Crystal 40, Crystal 120, Roasted Barley, Dextrose

","This Imperial Red was brewed with a unique blend of crystal malts to impart intense flavors of toffee, caramel and subtle burnt sugar. A touch of Munich and Wheat malts round out the mouthfeel to allow for an onslaught of hoppy goodness. Hopped with Summit, Chinook, Centennial, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic hops at five pounds per barrel. Resinous hop flavors of citrus, passionfruit, pine trees and berries perfectly accompany the malt character. This complex, hoppy ale is perfect for the cold weather. Come blast off with Commander Clifford in his big red hop rocket!

","Heady aromas of autumn spices give tones of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.  Above all, however, this is a beer and hops prevail.  This deep-amber ale is best enjoyed as the leaves begin change and the daylight hours become shorter.

","Rob Your Head Imperial Red - an autumnally inspired seasonal recipe - is riding back into town and this time it's bringing posse! Join us each fall for the draft return + 16 oz. can release of this deep malty rouge, dry-hopped Imperial Red Ale. 
Originally brewed on our 5-barrel pilot system, the return of this stark Imperial Red Ale complements our year-round offerings during the fall. Roasted & caramel malts deliver a robust, ruby body that is balanced by assertive bitterness and a big dry-hop of classic American IPA hops. Simcoe + Amarillo combine for piney and citrusy aromas to make this beer one to enjoy from first glance to last sip.

","Seconde bière de la brasserie.
Bière ambrée de fermentation haute (Red Ale), elle a nécessité pas moins de 6 malts différents et 2 variétés de houblon.
D’une belle robe ambrée aux reflets rougeâtres, la BarFumée propose au nez de superbes arômes de malt fumés et tourbés. En bouche, de légères touches de caramel viennent se marier aux arômes tournés et fumés. Finale assez longue sur le malt et le houblon, procurant une légère sensation citronnée et herbeuse. L’amertume finit le tout, bien fondue dans le corps ample de la bière.

","This amber ale is modeled after the Alt (old) beers of northern Germany. Simultaneously rich and crisp, this beer exhibits strong caramel malt flavors without being sweet or cloying. This delicate balance is achieved though the careful use of Sterling and Willamette hops for an earthy, herbal character. We use the Hefeweizen yeast for this beer, but ferment it cold to enhance the lager-like character. The Algonquin mine was one of the first major silver lodes in the area, and later produced manganese to support both world war efforts.Added by jzeilinger on 07-10-2017"

","1905 is an amber ale whose amber-red colour comes from RedX malt, and whose sweetness is derived from Vienna malt. The beer’s restrained bitterness is a result of traditional European hops being added right at the end of the cooking process.

The beer was first brewed in September 2015 to support music and arts education programs in Pataskala, Ohio, where Stone co-founder Greg Koch grew up. People there loved it, so we added the beer to our seasonal lineup. The deep crimson hue is courtesy of a fairly new special German malt variety by BESTMALZ called Red X.

","Ommegang and HBO® announce the newest beer in the Game of Thrones® collaboration series. Through its first three seasons, the critically acclaimed drama has become the biggest show on HBO.
Named after the motto of House Targaryen, Fire and Blood is inspired by Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion. To celebrate the rebirth of dragons, three different labels were created by the Game of Thrones visual effects specialists, each depicting one of Daenerys' feared dragons. Randomly distributed amongst the cases, each case will contain all three bottles.
On sale March 31, in time for the debut of Season 4, Fire and Blood makes for the perfect season premiere pairing. The beer is available in 750ml bottles and 1/6 barrel kegs.
Fire & Blood is a 6.8% ABV Red ale, brewed with pilsner, Cara-60, Midnight Wheat, flaked rye and spelt. Assertive hopping includes CTZ, Styrian Golding and German Tettnang hops. Spiced with de-seeded Ancho chilies. Fire & Blood has a deep, dark red hue with a persistent, creamy, off-white head. Aromas of ripe fruit, raisins, malt & slight spice, followed by a slightly floral and spicy hop character.

Using only traditional ingredients, Switchback Ale is a reddish-amber ale which is particularly well-balanced, allowing for complexity of flavor coupled with an unusually smooth and refreshing character. Five different malts, select hop varieties, and our own specially cultivated yeast create an ale which leads with hop flavors and a subtle impression of fruit (our yeast's contribution), followed by a palate pleasing malty finish. Our own special process uses the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer, and we leave it unfiltered.

","Substantial amounts of late-kettle hop additions and dry-hopping yields a heady blend of fruity aromas of pineapple, peach and citrus. Those aromas continue into a crisply bitter hop presence across the tongue, but the judicious use of toasted and caramel specialty malts prevents the hop intensity from overwhelming the palate.
Locally sourced Michigan honey creates a smooth, dry finish that pulls everything together.
The India Red Ale style is a variation on the IPA, but with more caramel and toasted malt character and a reddish hue.

","Stop seven on our multi-year trip to explore the state of New Jersey through its beer and culture, is Exit 9, best known as the Rutgers University exit. The state’s university, Rutgers, began in 1771 with classes held at a local tavern though by 1810, students were banned from frequenting “beer and oyster houses.” Alumni include Nobel Laureates, astronauts, brewery founders, authors, actors and perhaps most notably, the cartoon character Mr. Magoo.
To celebrate Exit 9, we brewed a richly flavored red beer crafted with a variety of domestic and imported malts and a classic American yeast strain. Assertively hopped with Amarillo, Centennial, Chinook and Citra, the bouquet has complex notes of citrus and tropical fruits, with an appropriate bitterness in the finish. Serve it with spicy foods (try gumbo or curry), a rich blue or sharp cheddar cheese or enjoy it by itself.Added by womencantsail on 02-11-2011"

","Runabout Red Ale is a classic! Our Red Ale has a malty sweet taste that comes from 3 different types of caramel malt. It is a clean, well-balanced beer that started as seasonal ale that we only brewed from March until July. It was so popular with our regulars that we started brewing it year round in 2002. Our red ale is made with only two hop additions to the kettle as opposed to three in most of our other brews and the malt character shows this. Please enjoy our staff favorite!

","A double red ale that seems to indicate an intensity of flavor simply by it’s dark reddish brown appearance. Subtle aromas of candy, brown sugar, and toasted malt seem reluctantly released from the depths of this full bodied beast. Raisins, figs, and burnt caramel are among some of the sweeter flavors up front, before giving way to a roasted cocoa like bitterness that becomes magnified by high alpha hops. Considering the initial overall sweetness, it’s a heightened bitterness that dominates the finish.

This is a heavy-duty 9% abv red ale with a profusion of hop flavor and aroma.  This beer is as big and proud as Texas. Because we add almost two pounds of American hops per barrel very late in the beer making process, The Imperial Texan is able to retain a wondrously piney and resinous hop character that perfectly balances its smooth but strong and dry malt backbone.  This beer has a sticky presence that puts each sip perfectly on the tongue.

The beer was such a hit at this party, we decided to start Prism Brewing Company.

","Formerly Rebel Kent The First
Every sip of Rebel Kent is a science experiment in your mouth. We’ve always been fascinated by the Abbey Single, the beer of choice for Belgian monks working the fields. They were low in alcohol and high in flavor, but had one problem: they were cloyingly sweet. So we hit the books to develop a modern take on that classic idea. We found our answer in an unlikely place: the human tongue. We learned that our palates experience flavor in stages: sweetness at the front and spiciness at the back, and we designed a beer that follows that pattern. The sweetness from the Belgian yeast hits first, and is quickly balanced by a rye-malt spice, leaving you with a clean palate, ready for the next science-y sip.
This is our daily drinker, an amber ale for today’s hard workers. It’s a nod to our brewing ancestors: the rebel monks of the fields.

","This beer is a revival of a beer style that was one of the most popular beers in America prior to prohibition: Kentucky Common Ale. It has a dark color with a rich flavorful taste and a decent hint of hops (22 IBU), but it is light and easy drinking.
Many people today mistakenly think that this style is supposed to have a sour taste, but our research led us to the over 100 year old ""American Handy Book of the Brewing, Malting & Auxiliary Trades"" (see page 818) which makes no mention of it having a sour quality or using a sour mash to brew it.
Instead, it was just a dark yet refreshing beer that the working class people of the time loved to drink very fresh, which was around 2 weeks after being brewed. We also serve up Common Sense 14 days after brewing it. It is a great resurrected beer for all modern beer lovers!Added by tviz33 on 06-15-2013"

","This is a big, bold beer that is loaded with five types of hops but also backed up with a hearty grain that establishes balance and body. This deep copper coloured beer has beautiful spicy and a slight citrus hops note right from the start with a rounded malt finish accompanying the hop bitterness.
Immediately after pouring the beer, you will notice a full, rocky head form at the top of your glass that preserves all the flavour and allows the slow release of the hop focused aroma. As you drink and enjoy your beer you will notice the head take on a thick and rocky appearance as it creates some wonderful lacing down the side of your glass.

","Our Bone Warmer is brewed the same way, using only the first runnings from an extraordinarily thick, strong mash of Idaho 2-Row Metcalfe and Harrington barley malt, along with dark German Munich and caramel malts. We subtly spiced it with Idaho Chinook hops, fermented it at cool temperatures and cold-conditioned it for smoothness and drinkability.
The resulting ale is the color of roasting chestnuts. It is voluptuously malty and only slightly sweet- with a hint of toffee and a warming dry finish. It’s an ideal accompaniment to rich meaty stews, wild game, roasted fowl or root vegetables, and aged cheddars.Added by Bitterbill on 01-13-2007"

","A mid strength ale like no other
Velvet smooth, Rogers weaves together the best whole hop flowers and toasted malts into a silky mid strength ale like no other. We’re always open to new ideas and seeking advice from others and with this beer we salute two great men and legends of Australian brewing who helped us along the way; Roger Bailey and Roger Bussell.
With a gentle nod to the traditions of fine English Ales and a distinctive Little Creatures hop driven slant, Rogers’ beer may be hard to classify but it’s reassuringly easy to drink…
Whole hop flowers used in the brewing process deliver a gentle bitterness and light citrus hop notes that weave together with roasted toffee and caramel malt flavours to create this unique, easy-drinking amber ale.

Cherry Wood Smoked Malt and English Golden Naked Oats give this beer a truly unique flavor. Slight smokiness pairs well with the nuttiness from the oats and great flavor from German Chocolate Wheat Malt. A great beer to pair with BBQ, fish, or any hearty meal!

","Why should St. Patrick’s Day just be a “day” when you can make a whole season out of it?! Crack open The Craic and let the friendly banter, bursts of laughter, and toe-tapping music of the season get your eyes smiling.
This hybrid ale combines two classic styles —IPA and Irish Red Ale—to create a unique and flavorful beer. Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.
The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. 
Check ‘em out: 
Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). 
Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.
Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. 
Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. 
Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. 
Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!Added by braican on 11-21-2016"

","Your father’s red ale was pretty to look at but not much to drink, seriously in need of a personality transplant. But over the years, red ales have turned into the real deal, with a character as lively and big as any pale ale. Reppin’ Red blends seven malts for layer upon layer of caramel and toasted toffee with the uniquely peppery spiciness of rye and tops it all off with a mix of selected Pacific Northwest hops, chosen for their lively flavors and sophisticated aromas of flowers, pine and citrus. It’s a big beer that demands big food. Reppin’ Red is fantastic with grilled meat and steaks, and totally rocks a burger. For something different, try it with blue cheese or a nice, sweet slice of carrot cake—you’ll be amazed.Added by dhannes on 08-28-2012"

","It was important to us to create a beer that was well balanced and easy drinking. John Carr achieved this with Trout Town American Amber Ale. True to its name TTAA has a beautiful Amber color and produces a near perfect head when pouring. The blend has a very light citrus finish, with balanced malt and hops. By no means is it extreme in anyway. It has a nice light finish and is a great product to enjoy all night long or while relaxing after spending the day in the great outdoors! This style of beer would have been typically brewed in New York State during the early 1900's. IBU's 30-40, Color (SRM) 8-18, ABV 5 – 6%.Added by Jason on 10-01-2013"

","Downpour balances on the boarder between malt and huge hop flavors, much like the balance between warm summer days and the bitter cold thunderstorms we get here in the high country of Colorado. The beer pours a hazy redwood red with a white fluffy head. Hops dominate the nose with pine, earth, and grapefruit balanced slightly by caramel malt flavors and hints of our fruity London Ale yeast. The beer hits the palate with bitter hop notes of pine and is balanced by bready malt. A beer for the hop freaks among us.

","Hard water. Appropriate for a pale ale style, this gives something for the hop oils to stick to, and the right water chemistry and pH levels for a proper British style bitter or pale ale. Our water chemistry provides mineral flavor and body to complement the complex malt and hop ingredients that are drawn from the best of English, German and Pacific Northwestern U.S. traditions and sources.  The mineral factor enhances the processing steps in mashing, sparging, boiling, fermenting and conditioning. The malt bill includes English 2-row Pale Ale Barley Malt and Malted Whole Wheat. Hops include Chinook, Hallertau, Cascade, Willamette and Tettnang. Shipyard's lively Ringwood culture (a top-fermenting ""ale"" yeast) is used to ferment the beer, as was the case when we brewed in Hartford.Added by Billolick on 07-25-2006"

","Doc Perdue was Blyth’s veterinarian in the late 1880’s who had a penchant for collecting exotic animals and a love of drink. When once cut off for being over served at the local saloon, he marched home and returned with a bobcat on a leash, threatening to let it loose if he didn’t get another drink. 
West Coast American Pale Ales and IPAs have inspired Doc Perdue’s Bobcat. Hops are loaded from top to bottom in this ruby red beer showing off aromatic pine, zest, fresh citrus and tropical fruit. The body is smooth and gently bitter, while the hop aromas are bright and vibrant.Added by Sammy on 09-18-2016"

","The town of Long Valley was originally called German Valley after the German immigrants that first settled in and cultivated it's fertile land. Evidence of these first settlers can still be seen in the skillful stone construction of many of the Valley's buildings and barns, including the Long Valley Pub and Brewery. The original walls and graves of a 16th century Lutheran church can still be found just across the bridge on Fairview Avenue. The German Valley Amber Ale derives its firebrick red color from a combination of crystal and specially roasted malts. This is an assertive beer with a notable bitterness and respectable strength. Willamette hops are used in generous quantities to make this pleasantly hop-flavored ale.Added by yen157 on 02-16-2003"

","What?
Inspired by the malty and hoppy beers of the Great Northwest, Green Man Ale is a rich and layered beer that lies somewhere between an IPA and a Red Ale—not exactly radical, but not quite the conformist, Green Man Ale just is.
Why?
An Eclectic blend of malts and plenty of northwest hops have come together, not worrying about fitting in, and simply being content in walking their own path of malty hoppiness (always need a good hop pun). Green Man is excellent when paired with wild salmon or as an inspirational elixir during your favorite pagan ceremony.Added by Domingo on 02-12-2012"

","Known as underground savages, prospectors of the BC gold rush were rewarded handsomely for their TOIL. Rumour has it that, in the saloons of Barkerville, there was so much gold dust shed from miner’s clothes that a profit could be made just by sweeping the floor. 
Cash in with 18 Karat Ale, a smooth and balanced blend of malted barley and hops that will lure you back for the motherload.

Fall Ale is made with all German malts - Munich, Vienna, Cara malt, and a little bit of Rye. It's generously hopped with Hallertauer and Tettnang hops from Germany. It's an ale, not a lager, but it's loosely based on a typical Octoberfest beer, with our own twist with the Rye malt.Added by Misfit138 on 10-17-2009"

","A deep garnet, Iron Spike Amber pours a dense frothy beige cap with good lacing and retention. To the nose, toasted notes of dark bread and caramel malts as well as deeply rooted dark fruits give way to a perfume of bubblegum, banana, and yeasty esters. 
The flavour profile is initially sweet with dark fruit and caramel. This leads to toasted and spicy flavours with a hint of smoke and fall fruits while the hops come through to balance the sweetness. This full-bodied amber ale is an ideal balance of creamy grainy fruitiness, and sharp hops bitterness.Added by mrmanning on 06-06-2008"

","A kin to its Scottish and Irish cousins, this American Red Ale is full bodied and smooth. Its blend of caramel and specialty malts give this ale a deep amber color and a silky smooth malty texture. It’s gentle touch of American hops balance the malt sweetness and provide just a touch of earthy flavors. A slight astringency accompanies this on the sides of the tongue from chocolate malt which lends to the ruby red color. It finishes smooth and dry. Try it paired with your menu choice of barbequed meats, burgers, or steaks.Added by ManekiNeko on 03-01-2005"

","The newest addition to the Forked River lineup is a bold Canadian red ale. Hopped exclusively with North American varietals, this amped up pale ale delivers their citrusy goodness alongside significant caramel flavours and a little residual malt sweetness, helping to balance the elevated bitterness. Clocking somewhere between a pale ale and an IPA, Red Coat is a full-flavoured, 6.2% ABV, 45 IBU, dry-hopped red ale.  We brewed this beer specifically for BBQ weather - it fits perfectly beside a juicy burger or strip loin steak, cutting right through that richness without stripping away any flavour from that amazing grilled goodness.Added by MasterSki on 05-14-2015"

","This beer is the third installment of a beer brewed for head brewpub brewer Wil’s daughters, Gabrielle and Ciara. (First Hop Princess, then Rebellious, and now Battle of Wil's.)
Patagonia malt gives this medium-bodied brew its amber/reddish hue and toffee-like notes in the nose. On front of the palate, however, it is quite mild - not as sweet as one might expect. The single hop variety used, Centennial, makes its fresh presence known mid-palate.
The beer finishes clean, with a medium hop bitterness. Though a shade darker than the Iron Fist, it is lighter-bodied, a bit cleaner, and a bit lower IBUs.

","This is our version of the American Amber Ale style, and is amber in color (of course), medium bodied, with toasty malt flavors, and a subtle hop finish. This beer is brewed from Montana-grown and malted Metcalfe 2-row barley, two kinds of English crystal malts and just a hint of torrifed (toasted) wheat, and is lightly hopped with Magnum and British East Kent Goldings. Easy drinking yet always satisfying.

","Double Dry Hopped Imperial Red India Pale Ale
Inspired by one of the greatest race horses to ever live, Secretariat’s Meadow is a grand-champion in the making. As dark in color as the Triple Crown winner and with a heart twice the size of the competition, Secretariat’s Meadow explodes with the flavor and aroma of Mosaic hops. Mosaic hops feature complex flavors and aromas akin to tangerines, papaya, roses and fresh blossoms. To enhance these characteristics we double dry-hopped the beer for maximum effect. Born in The Meadow. Destined for Greatness.

","This Scottish Red Ale is full bodied, with a natural sweetness and rounded balance derived from a rich blend of malts and light hops. At 5% ABV, it is a sessionable ale that goes with any meal. This beer was first introduced by MBC in 2008 and won the award for “Best Montana Beer” at the Garden City Brewfest.

","Our Absolution Ale is an American Amber Ale in style. This is a style that has evolved in the last 12 years with the explosion of the microbrewery movement. Ours was brewed with American Grains, American hops, and by American brewers. It is a reasonably big beer with a full profile. This means that it has a big body and a good balance of the malt and hops with neither overpowering the other. The body of the Absolution Ale is full with nice caramel tones, and should finish a touch sweet. The hop character is most noticeable as a hop flavor although it will have some hop bitterness in the finish. Let me know how you like it.Added by BeerAdvocate on 04-12-2006"

","Amber beers are a style that fall between light pale ales and brown ales.  They are generally categorized as pale ale.  This beer is dark amber in colour, has traces of citrus in its aroma, and one can pick up hints of caramel and coffee in its full bodied flavour.  Though it is fairly well hopped, the robust character and complexity of this fine amber turns it into nectar of the gods that no serious beer drinker should pass up.

","Originally created for Cask Days, this beer is a hoppy but not bitter, full-bodied red ale. We triple-hopped this batch with Legacy, Simcoe, and Galaxy to create subtle blueberry, citrus and pine notes to compliment it’s caramel malt flavour. Weighing in at 6.2% ABV with a deep ruby red hue, this beer is calculated at 40 IBUs to showcase the hops without overpowering the palate.Added by MasterSki on 10-24-2014"

It was a bronze medal winner at the 2000 & 2009 NABA awards and is a robust “beer drinker’s” amber. Amber in color with slight residual sweetness from caramel malts balanced well with Golding hops.

","We replaced 100% of our brewing water with Maple sap straight from locally tapped Maple trees, which lends an underlying wood-like character similar to the effect of oak barrel aging. Caramel and Munich malts play a supporting role to the familiar flavor of Maple syrup. Being a simple sugar, maple is easily fermented down to a dry, refreshing finish!

","Drink Well Red Ale is as complex as it is simple. A robust Irish style red ale with a uniquely American twist. A floral nose with a touch of citrus coming from American Willamette Hops leads into a rich, malty backbone with big caramel and toffee notes, met in the middle with a distinctly toasty, mildly chocolaty finish. This drinking ale goes down smooth and finishes just dry enough to leave you craving another sip, then another pint!Added by Dicers on 03-16-2015"

","Our Red Ale has a blend of medium to dark crystal malts to give way to a toasted caramel profile. Mosaic, Galaxy, Cascade and Centennial hops are used throughout, giving this dry hopped beer notes of pineapple, stone fruit, and grassy hop flavors and aromas. The Red Ale has a firm bitterness that does not overpower, but balances the sweetness of the malt and then ends with a dry session-able finish.Added by Boone757 on 03-27-2014"

So we found it only fitting to brew a beer for Linda, Todd’s partner in crime in every aspect of life, since this couple has become very good friends of Amager. Linda is not only cool and badass, she also has the biggest heart you can imagine. And for the brew day she came here and worked her butt off to brew the beer we created as a collaboration.

","Rob Your Head Imperial Red - an autumnally inspired seasonal recipe - is riding back into town and this time it's bringing posse! Join us at the beginning of fall for draft return + 16 oz. can release of this deep malty rouge, dry-hopped Imperial Red Ale. 
Originally brewed on our 5-barrel pilot system, the return of this stark Imperial Red Ale complements our year-round offerings during the fall. Roasted & caramel malts deliver a robust, ruby body that is balanced by assertive bitterness and a big dry-hop of classic American IPA hops. Simcoe + Amarillo combine for piney and citrusy aromas to make this beer one to enjoy from first glance to last sip.Added by bigwilley18 on 04-17-2016"

","RIP Tyson Archimedes Montrucchio. Gone, but certainly not forgotten we brewed this kickass Red Ale for our fallen friend Tyson. As a tribute to the intensity with which he lived life we packed this beer with a sh*t ton of love and respect. From a grain bill comprised of 2-Row Pale, Crystal 75, Munich, Victory (that’s where the biscuityness comes from), and Chocolate malts, to a hop profile of Cascade and Mt. Hood, we didn’t pull any punches on this one. As a full bodied Red Ale that isn’t over the top, the Archimedes Red is our TCB go to beer, and is a constant reminder that we all need to be thankful for each new day with our friends and family.

","The Wrangler Red ale is a clear, deep reddish brown color and full bodied.  It begins with moderate hop and caramel aromas and a creamy mouth-feel. The Wrangler red provides strong malt flavors that create mild sweetness followed by smooth caramel flavor.  The malt and low hop bitterness nicely balance into the slight roasty finish.

","This amber ale was brewed in the style of a German altbier. 'Altbier' literally means 'old beer,' referring to the era when Germans brewed ales instead of the lagers of today. The style is a bit of a hybrid of ale and lager in that it is brewed with an ale yeast, but is fermented at cooler than normal temperatures for an ale, and aged (lagered) before serving. The resulting beer has a pleasing malt character character, but is drier and not as heavy as most of our beers. The maltiness is balanced by a crisp hop character that is spicier than it is bitter. The fact that the hops are all of German origin accounts for this spicy hoppiness. The Amber is a deep copper color, which makes it an attractive as well as tasty brew.""

","Brewed with imported pale malt, Honey malt for flavor, three types of caramel malt for color and flavor, Vienna and Munich malt for body. The ruby red color hints at its rich caramel maltiness. Hopped with a good amount of German hops to tame the sweetness. This is a perfect middle-of-the-road beer for those who do not want a beer that is too light, too dark, or too bitter.

","One of our most popular brews this one is the perfect balance of English style maltiness and an American influenced hop bill.

","There is such a thing as true happiness. The proof: whiskey and beer. So we worked with our Irish brethren to help marry the two. Introducing Imperial Irish Red Aged in Jameson Barrels. This richly robust, mahogany-hued ale has notes of fig, toffee, tobacco and whiskey. Aged for 6 months in Jameson Irish Whiskey barrels, this full bodied-beer has flavors of vanilla, molasses, dried stone fruits and black cherries with a distinctly peppery finish. Indulgent, subtly sweet with a warming linger, this is a beer meant to be sipped and savored.Added by jaydoc on 07-11-2016"

","This full-bodied Red IPA is packed with floral and spicy American-grown hops. The deep red color comes from the amber waves of Crystal, Munich and a-row malt, just like the rust on the Rattle Trap in the garage. Subtle caramel notes bring balance to the nose, and the piney citrus finish lingers like a summer sunset on the lake!

","This is not your typical Amber beer. We’re big fans of rye, and we couldn’t pass up a chance to use it in a new way. Rye, caramel malts, and lightly roasted barley set up an interesting malt foundation for fruity and herbaceous hops. We’re also huge fans of Belgian style ales, so we threw caution to the wind and fermented it all with a clean, fruity yeast. It’s easy to drink, but it has a bit more complexity and depth than you might expect from an Amber.

","Description: 
Inspired by our favorite local Thai restaurant, this recipe blends all of the flavors that make this dessert such a unique treat. A Copper Ale base incorporates Khal Koah (Thai toasted rice infused with lemongrass and kefir lime leaves) into the mash, then added coconut, brown sugar, and spicy Thai peppers in the boil. We, of course, finished with a full bunch our own “Farmhouse Flambéed” Bananas.

","Parcel of Rogues is a full-bodied Amber Ale - made with Mild malt, and some Honey Malt which adds a nice delicate sweetness. There's lots mouthfeel without a high alcohol content - it rings in at 4.6%/ABV. It's intended to be a throwback to the days of being able to have a good hearty beer or two in the afternoon, and still be functional - it's a Session Ale for all intents and purposes!

","The Jagged Shard Imperial Red Ale clocks in at 8.4% ABV and 80 IBU's. This brew pours a dark red copper color and offers a pleasant citrus fruit aroma. Very balanced flavor profile between the strong melanoiden rich malt backbone and the complimentary but assertive hop character. Very smooth and deceiving for a high gravity brew until you feel the unmistakable alcohol warmth in your cheeks after a few sips. Enjoy this one responsibly, but enjoy it you will.Added by JohnGalt1 on 04-08-2016"

We took the Lonesome Boatman recipe and ""imperialized"" it. Same malts, same hops, same lovable Lonesome Boatman flavor...except Electric Boatman weighs in at 8% ABV and is boldly dry hopped with Simcoe hops. Simcoe brightens up the Boatman family, so we wish your experience with family and friends is every bit as wonderful as this new brew.

","You’ll want to clear your nose before indulging in this juicy amber. This beer has American and Australian hops bursting with tropical fruits with loads of lemon and grapefruit with a deep malt backing to compliment the hops and give this beer its amber colour. This easy to drink beer is very sneaky at just under 6%.

","This amber ale has a subtle hop backbone that shows off a complex malt character with crystal malts from Chile. They display the common characteristics of carmel, toffee and lightly roasted flavors of crystal malts but with more depth and presence. Malty goodness, medium body.Added by Electros on 02-17-2016"
